FriendSplit - A simple app that allows you to quickly split a payment, like a restaurant bill, with friends after external factors are added such as gratuity, tax, etc. In this app, you can also add friends and showcase them (popularity feature), have history of how much you owe someone, send a message along with the payment, and a simple/aesthetic UI.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Connected the Ui to logic incorrectly by placing it before the actual display code ran so it didnt work. Then tried to delete the code only but realized i had to first go to the Connections Inspector and empty the actions.
